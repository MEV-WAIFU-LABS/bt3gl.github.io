## singularity.sh blog

### tl, dr

* years ago I used to have a blog at [https://singularity.sh](https://web.archive.org/web/20180626032114/http://bt3gl.github.io/)_
* i had really cool articles on hacking, ctf, ai, etc there
* the blog died at some point because life
* now (2023), i re-deployed it to singularity.miavonsteinkirch.com so i can keep the history and proof-of-og =)
* it was generated with python pelican (check `BLOG_GENERATOR/` to reproduce/rebuild)
* enjoy 🤷🏻‍♀️
