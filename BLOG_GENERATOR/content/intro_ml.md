At Apple, I had the chance to learn a lot of deep learning while working with the team that develops its DNN toolkit. Today I have open-sourced my **personal** studies:

* [🚀 My Resources for AI, ML, and DNN](https://github.com/mvonsteinkirch/Machine-Learning-Resources).
* [🛰 CUDA Studies for Deep Learning Problems](https://github.com/mvonsteinkirch/CUDA_Studies_For_Deep_Learning).


Additionally, when I was in my Ph.D. I had the pleasure of doing [some nice work on Machine Learning](http://singularity-sh.vercel.app/projects_page/html_files/ml.html) as well. Here is the open-sourced code for you:


* [💎Advanced Machine Learning](https://github.com/mvonsteinkirch/Advanced-Machine-Learning).
* [🍭 MLNet - Classifying Complex Networks with ML](https://github.com/mvonsteinkirch/MLNet-Classifying-Complex-Networks).
* [🔋 NetClean - Complex Networks Data-Cleanser](https://github.com/mvonsteinkirch/NetClean-Complex-Networks-Data-Cleanser).
* [🌺 NetAna - Complex Network Analysis Package](https://github.com/mvonsteinkirch/NetAna-Complex-Network-Analysis).
